// JS is a dynamic type language where data types are automatically assigned to variables

let firstName = 'John'; // You can also use double quotes for string like "John" but using single quotes is a bit modern
console.log(firstName);

let lastName = 'Smith';
let age = 32; // Floating point numbers by default (both integer and decimals)

let fullAge = true; // Boolean data type true/false
console.log(fullAge);

let job; // undefined data type
console.log(job);

job = 'Doctor';
console.log(job);

let noData = null; // null data type
console.log(noData);

// Rules for naming variables:

// let 10bucks = 10; // can't use number at the start of variable names

// let me&you = 'Me and you'; // can't use any characters except _ and $ in variable names

let _10bucks = 10; // correct

// let if = 'else' // can't use reserved js keywords as variable names
